# Cymatic Resonance Explorer

A collection of tools for exploring wave patterns, resonance, and mathematical beauty through visual oscilloscopes.

## Main Application

**`main/living_oscilloscope.py`** - The complete Living Oscilloscope
- Genetic wave evolution that hunts for mathematical harmony
- Real-time flowing waveforms with persistence trails
- Automatic pattern detection and logging
- 60fps smooth performance with threaded computation

### Usage
```bash
cd main
python living_oscilloscope.py
```

Hit POWER to start evolution. Watch waves flow and morph as they explore frequency space, automatically locking onto resonant patterns when discovered.

## Archive

**`archive/`** contains the development history:
- `emergence.py` - Rule 30 cellular automaton demos
- `resonance.py` - Static wave interference patterns  
- `oscilloscope.py` - Manual slider-based oscilloscope
- `resonance_detector.py` - Core pattern detection algorithms
- `cymatic_explorer.py` + `cymatic_explorer_clean.py` - Earlier GUI attempts

## Concepts Explored

- **Emergence**: How simple rules create complex, beautiful patterns
- **Resonance**: Mathematical harmony in frequency relationships  
- **Genetic Evolution**: Waves that evolve toward mathematical beauty
- **Real-time Visualization**: Flowing oscilloscope displays
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automated detection of harmonic structures

## Dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy tkinter
```
